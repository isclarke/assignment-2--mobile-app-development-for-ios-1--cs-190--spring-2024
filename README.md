## ❖ Introduction ❖

For this assignment, you’ll be combining the solution to assignment 1 with what you’ve learned in the `QuestionBot` and `BouncyBall` apps. Via an iPhone app, the user should be presented with a prompt to enter the size of the diamond, which you’ll draw using `Points`, not asterisk characters, in an app’s `UIView`. Your program should print a diamond shape that doesn’t exceed the safe space of your phone’s view. Your program need only work in portrait.
